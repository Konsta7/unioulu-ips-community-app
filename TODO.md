## Issues

* The appwrite dotenv variables are inherently insecure, therefore the api key should be abstracted somehow.

* Uniform the way the appwrite api is called.

* Images require url in appwrite, no file upload.

* comments - post_id relationship is a string, not a relationship.

## Core features

* Settings view

* Logout functionality


## Upcoming Features

These are just my ideas, feel free to add your own.

* Polls (general ones, but also polls specific to an event)
* Surveys after an event
* Event chat
